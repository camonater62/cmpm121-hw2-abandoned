1. Add at least 4 lights to your scene (30 pts)

Use at least 4 out of the 5 following types:

- Point Light
X Directional Light
- Spotlight
- Area Light
- Emissive Material

Each light must be appropriately placed such that the range intersects with an object and the intensity is powerful enough to be visible.


2. Create a lighting transition (30 pts)

Pick one or the other:

- Day-to-night cycle
- UI button to switch between lights on/off/dimmed
 

3. Add a particle system (30 pts)

Pick one or the other:

- 2D Texture emitter
- 3D Mesh emitter
Note: You can use an emissive material in your particle system, which would count towards Part 1.

4. "Polished" look (10 pts)

- Cohesive scene
- Interesting lighting
- Good use of materials/textures

Extra credit:

5 pts - Include both of the lighting transitions (day/night cycle & on/off/dim button)
5 pts - Include two particle systems (2D texture emitter & 3D mesh emitter)
